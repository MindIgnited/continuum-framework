It provides a powerful yet simple way to build distributed applications, microservices architectures, and IoT systems without getting bogged down in the complexities of networking, transport protocols, or serialization.</p><h2 id="core-philosophy-the-framework-gets-out-of-your-way" tabindex="-1">Core Philosophy: The Framework Gets Out of Your Way <a class="header-anchor" href="#core-philosophy-the-framework-gets-out-of-your-way" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Core Philosophy: The Framework Gets Out of Your Way&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The central idea behind Continuum is simple: <strong>you shouldn&#39;t have to think about how things work—you should just be able to use them</strong>.</p><p>When you need dependency injection, you don&#39;t think about how the DI framework wires up your dependencies. You just use <code>@Autowired</code> or constructor injection, and it works. Continuum follows the same philosophy.</p><p>Want to expose a service remotely? Just add <code>@Publish</code> to your interface. That&#39;s it. The framework handles service discovery, serialization, transport, routing, and all the infrastructure details—you focus on building your application logic.</p><p>This means:</p><ul><li><strong>No boilerplate</strong>: Write your service interface, implement it, and you&#39;re done</li><li><strong>No configuration needed</strong>: Sensible defaults work out of the box</li><li><strong>No infrastructure knowledge required</strong>: You don&#39;t need to understand transport protocols or service discovery to get started</li><li><strong>When you need depth, it&#39;s there</strong>: The documentation covers internals, but you don&#39;t need them to use Continuum effectively</li></ul><h2 id="key-value-propositions" tabindex="-1">Key Value Propositions <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-value-propositions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Value Propositions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="build-faster" tabindex="-1">Build Faster <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-faster" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build Faster&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Stop writing boilerplate code for service communication. Continuum eliminates the need for REST endpoints, message queues setup, or manual serialization. Define your service interface, and the framework handles the rest.</p><h3 id="type-safe-across-languages" tabindex="-1">Type-Safe Across Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#type-safe-across-languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Type-Safe Across Languages&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Write services in Java and call them from TypeScript with full type safety. Or mix and match—Continuum&#39;s polyglot support means you can use the right language for each part of your system while maintaining type safety across boundaries.</p><h3 id="real-time-built-in" tabindex="-1">Real-Time Built-In <a class="header-anchor" href="#real-time-built-in" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Real-Time Built-In&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Continuum provides native support for streaming responses and event-driven communication—perfect for IoT applications where devices need to send continuous data streams or receive real-time updates.</p><h3 id="polyglot-support" tabindex="-1">Polyglot Support <a class="header-anchor" href="#polyglot-support" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Polyglot Support&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Currently supporting <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Golang</strong> coming soon.

Traditionally, this means REST APIs, message queues, service discovery, load balancing, and more. Continuum simplifies this to &quot;publish a service and call it&quot;—all the infrastructure is handled automatically.</p><h3 id="iot-device-integration" tabindex="-1">IoT Device Integration <a class="header-anchor" href="#iot-device-integration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;IoT Device Integration&quot;">​</a></h3><p>IoT applications need to handle streams of data from devices, send commands to devices, and manage connections.

The current implementation uses STOMP over WebSockets with JSON serialization, but custom transports can be implemented.</li><li><strong>Service Discovery &amp; Registration</strong>: Services are automatically discovered and registered. No manual service registry configuration needed.</li><li><strong>Event Streaming</strong>: Built-in support for event streams, perfect for IoT scenarios where devices emit continuous data.</li><li><strong>Multiple Deployment Patterns</strong>: Whether you&#39;re building a single service, multiple microservices, or a full-stack application, Continuum supports your architecture.</li></ul><p>The beauty of this architecture is that you don&#39;t need to understand it to use it.
